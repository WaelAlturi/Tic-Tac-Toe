# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Open the [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://waelalturi.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/) in your browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the cells to place their symbol (X or O).
3. The game automatically switches turns between X and O.
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Development Setup

To set up the project locally for development or customization:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Tic-Tac-Toe
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to play the game.

## Game Logic

The game logic is implemented in the `script.js` file. It handles player turns, checking for win conditions, and restarting the game.
